        Hsing-Hui is a Texas-born Taiwanese-American Dutch-speaking francophile who, at any given moment in her life, found herself where she was mostly by accident.  She has chased frisbees and adventures in twenty-four different countries across four continents, dabbled in teaching, translation, and coaching before deciding to becoming a web developer.  Her first experience with coding was through <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a>, where, enraged that she could not solve the problems without any knowledge of programming whatsoever, she concluded that she must not have been meant for the field. She is currently a member of the first cohort of Ada Developers Academy, which she likes very much.
